Mapbox GL JS

I have always been interested in maps and Mapbox has a very intuitive vector based map.  
I plan to use this further to create an interactive map with expanding details as the user zooms in on specific areas.
Mapbox is a great tool for customizable maps with many layers and interactions that can be added.  I chose it over google maps
and other maps that shall remain nameless because of it's ease of implimenting javascript features and interactive elements.
Mapbox has been around for several years and has offices in San Francisco and Washington, DC which is particularly appealing.
I am a huge fan of this library and I plan to use it much more in my future projects.
The documentation and examples on Mapbox's website were the only resources I really needed to learn.  It has very detailed examples of many features.
Interview questions would include, what is the difference between vector and raster images, what is a layer, and what are ways that data can be imported.


To run simply clone and run the index.html file in the browser.
